We've discussed that a reproducible analysis can be run by someone else and obtain the same result. But what if before you bug your colleague to use their time to re-run your analysis, you had a robot re-run your analysis? Robots don't get tired or have other deadlines to respond to and can be set up to re-run your analysis at any time. This is the basis of why automation is powerful tool for reproducibility.

```{r, fig.alt="Ruby wants to know if her analysis is reproducibly so she sets up an automation tool to re-run her analysis whenever she pushes changes to her analysis. This robot has a computer for a body and says 'I will re-run Rubyâ€™s analysis consistently and instantly upon whatever trigger she sets up.''", out.width = "100%", echo = FALSE}
