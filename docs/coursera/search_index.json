This material was created by the ITCR Training Network (ITN) which is a collaborative effort of researchers around the United States to support cancer informatics and data science training through resources, technology, and events. This initiative is funded by the following grant: National Cancer Institute (NCI) UE5 CA254170. Our courses feature tools developed by ITCR Investigators and make it easier for principal investigators, scientists, and analysts to integrate cancer informatics into their workflows. Please see our website at www.itcrtraining.org for more information.

Cancer researchers are working to apply their expertise to the analysis of these vast amounts of data but training opportunities to properly equip them in these efforts can be sparse. This includes training in reproducible data analysis methods. Data analyses are generally not reproducible without direct contact with the original researchers and a substantial amount of time and effort (Beaulieu-Jones and Greene 2017). Reproducibility in cancer informatics (as with other fields) is still not monitored or incentivized despite that it is fundamental to the scientific method. Despite the lack of incentive, many researchers strive for reproducibility in their own work but often lack the skills or training to do so effectively. Equipping researchers with the skills to create reproducible data analyses increases the efficiency of everyone involved. Reproducible analyses are more likely to be understood, applied, and replicated by others. This helps expedite the scientific process by helping researchers avoid false positive dead ends. Open source clarity in reproducible methods also saves researchers’ time so they don’t have to reinvent the proverbial wheel for methods that everyone in the field is already performing. This course introduces the concepts of reproducibility and replicability in the context of cancer informatics. It uses hands-on exercises to demonstrate in practical terms how to increase the reproducibility of data analyses. The course also introduces tools relevant to reproducibility including analysis notebooks, package managers, git and GitHub. 1.2 Target Audience The course is intended for students in the biomedical sciences and researchers who use informatics tools in their research. It is the follow up course to the Introduction to Reproducibility in Cancer Informatics course 1.3 Curriculum The course includes hands-on exercises for how to apply reproducible code concepts to their code. Individuals who take this course are encouraged to complete these activities as they follow along with the course material to help increase the reproducibility of their analyses. Goal of this course: To equip learners with a deeper knowledge of the capabilities of reproducibility tools and how they can apply to their existing analyses scripts and projects. 1.4 How to use the course This course is designed with busy professional learners in mind – who may have to pick up and put down the course when their schedule allows. Each exercise has the option for you to continue along with the example files as you’ve been editing them in each chapter, OR you can download fresh chapter files that have been edited in accordance with the relative part of the course. This way, if you decide to skip a chapter or find that your own files you’ve been working on no longer make sense, you have a fresh starting point at each exercise.

In this advanced course, we will dig deeper into Git and GitHub’s capabilities so you can really use this to your daily work’s advantage. But, to gain the benefit of these deeper GitHub skills it will require some new habits to be formed. Fully embracing the GitHub workflow will make your work more efficient and help you create more transparent and reproducible analyses! In this chapter we’re going to introduce you one by one to the basic git commands you’ll need as we do them! 3.2 Prerequisites for this chapter In order to complete this chapter you will need a GitHub account (it’s free). If you do not currently have a GitHub account, we recommend you go through our Intro to Github chapter from the Introduction to Reproducibility course first and then return to this chapter. 3.3 Set up a Git Client (GitKraken) Interaction with git and GitHub can be done completely from command line, but sometimes this can be harder to keep track of. So to help us navigate this, we recommend using a git client. There’s a lot of different clients out there, and they are generally free for most situations you will need. In this course we will take you through how to use GitKraken, one such git client. GitKraken is nice because they have lots of nice tutorials, it works pretty well, and its free for most use cases. But if you find GitKraken doesn’t work for you, you can explore other git clients. But for this course, we’ll be using GitKraken. 3.3.1 Install GitKraken Go here to install GitKraken. Follow their instructions to sign in with your GitHub account. It will ask you to authorize your GitHub account to connect to GitKraken. Click Authorize. You may find it helpful to watch GitKraken’s own tutorial (linked below) about how to “git” started, but we will also guide you through each step! GitHub has a whole host of terms that can feel like a whole language at first, but we’ll introduce them one at a time. To start, a lot of the GitHub workflow centers around handling copies of your code that are either stored on the internet (are remote) or are stored on your computer (are local). A repository, in the case of a data science project, is mostly synonymous with the word “project”. So using GitHub, a project will exist both as a remote repository and a local repository. (It will be on the internet on GitHub and on your computer). 3.4 Get the exercise project files In this course, you can work on the exercises from your own GitHub repository, but first we will need to set that up. Here we are providing you with the files you will want to upload to that repository. Depending on whether you prefer to use R or Python, you can choose to follow this course using one or the other. Get the Python project example files Click this link to download. Now double click your chapter zip file to unzip. For Windows you may have to follow these instructions). Get the R project example files Click this link to download. Now double click your chapter zip file to unzip. For Windows you may have to follow these instructions). 3.5 Start a GitHub repository With the project files you’ve downloaded in the location you would like them to be, open up your command line and navigate to that being your current directory using the cd and ls commands. Go to Github’s main page and click Sign Up if you don’t have an account. Follow these instructions to create a repository. As a general, but not absolute rule, you will want to keep one GitHub repository for one analysis project. Name the repository something that reminds you what its related to. For these examples, we’re calling using repository-name as our placeholder. Choose Public. Follow these instructions to add all the files that are inside the reproducible-R-example.zip or reproducible-python-example.zip file you downloaded to this new repository. This new repository you created should look something like this. 3.5.1 git clone Now you have a repository on GitHub online! But in our daily grind, we will work on this code from our own computer. So to set this up, we’ll need to clone it to our own computer. Cloning is just making a remote copy of the project local. So to get started, you will need to clone the GitHub repository you created that we will be using for the duration of this course. To clone a GitHub repository, using GitKraken. First, click Clone a repo. Then, choose where you’d like the repository to be on your computer using the Browse button. You will need to Copy + Paste your new repository’s url to where it says URL. Navigate to your repository on GitHub to copy the URL. Copying and pasting is advisable because any little typo will inhibit cloning. Now you are ready to click Clone the repository! It will ask you if you’d like to Open Now, click that. 3.5.2 Create a branch Handling branches is where you unleash the real benefit of GitHub, but it’s also the confusing part to get a hang of. The best way to get a grasp on what the branches represent is to create one and start using it. In GitKraken we can create a new branch; this will be your working copy. First, click the Branch button. Next, type in a branch name in the box that the cursor is blinking in. In our example, we are calling it a-new-branch. Now click Enter! Now you have a new branch! Now we can edit our files and code however we normally would. Go ahead and make an edit to any file in your new repository. If you’ve made a change to any file in your repository, it will appear in GitKraken and you can click on it to see the differences. If we want to add these file changes to our current branch, we need to commit them. Now that we have changes committed to our branch we are ready to also add them to the remote, internet copy! To do this, we will need to push our branch. To push means to add changes that are on your new branch to the remote branch (internet version). The word origin just refers to where your branch is stored on the internet. Choose your origin in the dropdown menu and click Submit. After a variable number of commits, your branch, called a-new-branch is a different version of the original code base that may have a nifty improvement to it. But our main goal is to add that nifty improvement to the main branch. To start this process of bringing in new changes to the main curated repository, we will create a pull request. From GitHub: Pull requests let you tell others about changes you’ve pushed to a GitHub repository. Once a pull request is sent, interested parties can review the set of changes, discuss potential modifications, and even push follow-up commits if necessary. Pull Requests are the meat of how code changes and improvements get reviewed and incorporated! A vast majority of the benefits of incorporating GitHub into your workflow centers around fully utilizing the power of pull requests! Now we can open up a pull request if we go to our GitHub repository on GitHub. After you click on Compare &amp; pull request you’ll be taken to a screen where you can add information about your changes. After you are done writing your description, click Create Pull Request! (If you don’t have your pull request description perfect don’t worry about it, you can always edit it later). Congrats! You’ve just opened a pull request! In an upcoming chapter we will discuss what information you should put in this pull request description to make it pertinent for yourself and whoever reviews your pull request. To summarize, this is what this workflow looks like: One more note, if you do want to use command line or you want to know more about the specific git commands that GitKraken is doing for you (might be handy for troubleshooting), the specific commands that can be used or Googled at each step are highlighted in red in the images, you just need to add git before them! So for example you would type git push in your command line in order to push your code. Or if you’d like to know more about pushing code, you can google git push. 3.6 More reading about GitHub Happy Git and GitHub for the useR by Bryan and Hester (2021).

That sentiment is at the heart of code review. Although most wouldn’t dare send out a manuscript for publishing without having our collaborators giving it a line-by-line review, people don’t always feel the same way about code. Parker (2017) describes code review: Code review will not guarantee an accurate analysis, but it’s one of the most reliable ways of establishing one that is more accurate than before. Not only does code review help boost the accuracy and reproducibility of the analysis, it also helps everyone involved in the process learn something new! An effective code review atmosphere is something that individuals and their team have to commit to (pun intended). Effective code review brings so many benefits not only to your project quality but also your communication skills through fostering a learning atmosphere! In this chapter and the next we will discuss the two sides of code review. Code review ideally includes at least two people: the author of the pull request and the reviewer of the pull request. Depending on your job context, we realize that sometimes authors have to become their own reviewers if code review is not something that can be prioritized by your institution or team. 4.2 Author responsibilities in code review The code review process begins with the creation of a pull request (which we practiced in the previous chapter). Successful and efficient code review is born out of quality communication, which is a skill set on its own. You can set up your reviewers (and yourself) up for success by knowing what basic information can help get the code review conversation going. Even if you end up being the only person who will review your own code, writing these things out is still very helpful and highly recommended. It can help you spot problems you might not have otherwise seen and generally help you document better for future you! 4.3 Characteristics of great pull requests 4.3.1 there’s plenty of context! What’s the story behind around the changes you are proposing? Sometimes when we are in the thick of a project we can make the mistake of assuming everyone knows what we know. This can unfortunately leave a huge burden on your reviewer to try to follow a paper trail to try to understand what you are doing. Before sending off a review request, re-read your PR description and think about the perspective of your reviewer. Err on the side that they have no idea what is happening on the project (because sometimes this is the case!) Tell a short story to explain what lead to you making these changes including attempting to answer these questions: What is the problem that these changes will solve? Do you have any URLs relevant issues or files you can share? What inspired you to take this approach – are there other things you tried? Are there other pull requests related to this change? 4.3.2 includes an explicit request for what kind of feedback is needed What would you like your reviewer to do with this pull request? Stating this explicitly can save both of you time in this code review. Are you still in the early stages and looking for a bigger picture review? Let them know that before they waste their time digging into the code line-by-line. Are you in the later stages and looking for detailed nit-picky review? Are you looking for feedback on the results or methods? 4.3.3 points out questionable areas that need extra attention Are there specific areas of the code you are having trouble with or are unsure about? Send a link to the specific lines in GitHub you are asking about. Are there results that are surprising, confusing, or smell wrong? Be sure to detail what you have dug into and tried at this point for any problematic points. 4.3.4 are relatively small and focused Try to make sure your pull requests aren’t too long! Code reviewing fatigue is very real. If you send a reviewer thousands of lines of code to review it will be very overwhelming to review or understand. 10 lines of code = 10 issues.500 lines of code = \"looks fine.\"Code reviews. — I Am Devloper ((iamdevloper?)) November 5, 2013 Alternatively, when you create a new branch try to set a very intentional (and relatively small) goal you would like to achieve with your upcoming pull request. Keeping your pull requests small and focused on one task at a time will not only help your reviewers but also will help yourself feel more accomplished and organized. Also recall that incremental changes are good! Perhaps you do have a very large restructuring of your repository you are trying to accomplish, but finding smaller reasonable sets of changes (which would each have their own pull requests) to reach that goal incrementally can help keep things more manageable. Using Stacked Pull Requests in GitHub 4.3.5 don’t ask a reviewer for help too soon Determining when a pull request is ready for review is a skill in itself. Pull requests that haven’t had enough time to be polished can put an unnecessarily larger burden on the reviewer. On the other hand, pull requests that have been hashed and rehashed in a silo might have benefitted from big picture feedback at an earlier stage of the code. This is something that you and your team can figure out a balance for in time using lots of communication! This being said, the first reviewer of your code should always be yourself! Take time to review your own changes by clicking on the Files Changed tab and going over that section carefully. Are all the changes included that you were expecting? Are there any changes you didn’t expect that are showing up? These can be symptomatic of a deeper problem. Definitely dig into anything that is not what you expected. Set aside your changes and return them in a few hours, or the next day. Looking at your changes with fresh eyes may also allow you to find things you didn’t notice before. Additional tip, if you don’t want others to look at your pull request yet because you are still working on reviewing it, you can change it to a draft pull request so no one reviews it before you are ready. This can also be a handy tactic to use if you just want to ask for big picture feedback someone but want to make it clear that it is not anywhere near ready for merging to main. 4.3.5.1 In summary: Let’s revisit our scenario with Avi and Ruby and see how Ruby could better prepare her changes for review: In this scenario Ruby was able to save Avi time in getting into the code review by being more specific about what kind of feedback she is looking for as well as links that explain the context behind these changes. Additionally, by supplying Avi with a smaller PR, Avi is less likely to be overwhelmed by Ruby’s request and be able to give her suggestions in a more timely manner. 4.4 Exercise: Create your pull request description Add a pull request template to your repository! This will help initiate consistent and clear communication around the pull requests in your repository. Pull request templates are a way to give yourself and other contributors prompts when starting a new pull request. See below for an example. The comments between &lt;!-- and --&gt; are html comments that will not show up so you don’t need to delete them if you don’t want to. On the right side, it shows how this template looks when it’s rendered. You can see this at any time by clicking Preview – this is true in other places in GitHub. 4.4.0.1 Set up a pull request template Create a new branch as we described in the previous chapter. In your local repository, create a folder called .github Download this pull request template file to get you started. Feel free to edit this file to your own needs and add it to the .github folder. Use GitKraken to add and commit this new file. Push this commit. Open up a pull request. Craft your pull request description based on what we discussed in this chapter. Click on the Files Changed tab and make sure it includes the .github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md file. Walk away from your pull request and then return later and review it yourself. Make any necessary changes. When you are ready, request a reviewer by choosing someone underneath Reviewer on the right side! 4.4.1 Preparing for the return of your review As you wait for your reviewer to get back to you, it can be helpful to remind yourself the purpose of code reviews get yourself in a positive mindset. You’ve given your reviewer information to help them help you and now is the time to wait. First of all, you should pat yourself on the back for engaging in code review. It does require more time and sometimes that can feel scary with looming deadlines, but kudos for being able to prioritize your commitment to creating increasingly reproducibility analyses! Remember that you are not your code and mistakes are all a part of the process! Putting your project out there can feel a tad vulnerable even. You may have felt the impulse to keep your code’s problems buried under a rug, but you pushed past that and are making your analyses transparent! Remember that hidden problems don’t get solved, but known problems are opportunities for reaching an even better end result than you imagined! When you receive a review back remember that you and the reviewer are on the same team and both want the best end result feasible for this project! They may suggest ideas that you love and can’t wait to implement. They also might suggest ideas you don’t agree with. Do your best to take all their comments as positive learning opportunities and look for ways to compromise and determine solutions collaboratively. 4.4.1.1 Recommended reading about code review Why code reviews matter (and actually save time!) by Radigan (2021).

There are three aspects to reviewing we will focus on: Identify areas in the code and documentation that are opportunities for improvement. Communicate your questions and concerns effectively and in a way that creates a positive atmosphere. Determine solutions collaboratively in a way that allows for a learning as well as a long term improved product. 5.2.1 What to look for! Depending on the goals of the project, and pull request there can be a lot to keep an eye out for. There are many articles out there about what to look for in a code review. Here’s some general points: Does the analysis answer the question it’s asking? Are the methods it uses to do so appropriate? Is the code clear and readable? Does it contain a healthy amount of comments and documentation for individuals not familiar with the project to understand generally what is going on? Is the code efficient with computational resources? (Are there areas it’s a bit too greedy with memory usage?) Does the code stick to the style and conventions of this project? Are there alternate scenarios where the current strategy might fail? (depending on the likelihood of this use case, this may be an instance for a new issue and for it to be addressed in a different pull request). 5.2.2 How to communicate it The pull request may be the author’s precious bundle. Try to be empathetic to the learning process! You are both working on this project together – assume you both want the best out of this project. If something seems wrong, work together to find a solution, don’t ever waste time on placing blame. Remember that everything sounds harsher when you don’t have in-person cues! In this example, Avi may be stating factual things, but without his pleasant and reassuring disposition, it can feel super harsh. If Avi had reframed his comments, they might be more effective in this collaboration. Babatunde (2018) suggests framing review comments in three ways to help communication: questions, suggestions, and appreciations. 5.2.2.1 Questions For example: What happens if this doesn’t get saved? Does it throw an exception or fails silently? The key is to be specific with the questions. Mention exact file names. Put comments on the line you are referring to. Explain what you think is happening and ask them to explain if that is correct. 5.2.2.2 Suggestions For example: I suggest you use an ArrayHelper getValue method here because of its error handling capability instead of accessing the value directly You could even go further by giving an example: $a = $b[‘key’]; would raise an error if key is not set but \\(a = ArrayHelper::getValue(\\)b, ‘key’); would return a null value if key is not set. Giving suggestions and explain not only how to implement it but why it might be preferred in this scenario is a great learning process both for the author and yourself. 5.2.2.3 Appreciations Start every review comment with an appreciation for the hard work completed! This goes a long way for creating a positive atmosphere. For example: Nice Job! Alice. I suggest we create an interface for this service so other substitute services can implement the interface as well, this would enable us change to a different service with very minimal efforts when the need arises. What do you think? Let’s see how Avi’s message could have been reworked to give a more effective review: This interaction reminds us that effective code review is steeped in empathy from both sides. Authors need to appreciate the time and effort the reviewer is spending to help them; while reviewers need to be sensitive to the amount of effort put in by the author already. 5.2.3 Exercise: Review Past you’s code Find the oldest code you wrote and currently have on your computer. Create a repository and pull request with this old code, following the general steps for creating a repository and pull request from the previous chapter. Request yourself as a reviewer. Review the code on Github using their docs as a guide for the mechanics of it.
